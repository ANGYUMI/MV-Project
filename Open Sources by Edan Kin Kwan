Icicle Bubbles is a WebGL experience by Edan Kwan. 
Unlike traditional 3D metaball effect, it only blends the depth. 
Which means there is no transparency support but in that case there is no need to deal with the blocked mesh. 
For the light scattering effect, it is faked by the depth blend and the depth blur with upside/downside rendering.

First of all, I want to say, my version of metaball is not a real metaball and there is no geometry bending. 
Here is a good example of a good proper 3D metaball by Jaume Sanchez Elias
